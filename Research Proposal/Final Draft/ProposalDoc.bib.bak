abstract = {â€”Spearphishing is a prominent targeted attack vector in today's Internet. By impersonating trusted email senders through carefully crafted messages and spoofed metadata, adver-saries can trick victims into launching attachments containing malicious code or into clicking on malicious links that grant attackers a foothold into otherwise well-protected networks. Spearphishing is effective because it is fundamentally difficult for users to distinguish legitimate emails from spearphishing emails without additional defensive mechanisms. However, such mecha-nisms, such as cryptographic signatures, have found limited use in practice due to their perceived difficulty of use for normal users. In this paper, we present a novel automated approach to defending users against spearphishing attacks. The approach first builds probabilistic models of both email metadata and stylometric features of email content. Then, subsequent emails are compared to these models to detect characteristic indicators of spearphishing attacks. Several instantiations of this approach are possible, including performing model learning and evaluation solely on the receiving side, or senders publishing models that can be checked remotely by the receiver. Our evaluation of a real data set drawn from 20 email users demonstrates that the approach effectively discriminates spearphishing attacks from legitimate email while providing significant ease-of-use benefits over traditional defenses.},

Cloud computing is surrounded by many security issues like securing data, and examining the utilization of cloud by the cloud computing vendors. The wide acceptance www has raised security risks along with the uncountable benefits, so is the case with cloud computing. The boom in cloud computing has brought lots of security challenges for the consumers and service providers. How the end users of cloud computing know that their information is not having any availability and security issues? Every one poses, Is their information secure? This study aims to identify the most vulnerable security threats in cloud computing, which will enable both end users and vendors to know about the key security threats associated with cloud computing. Our work will enable researchers and security professionals to know about users and vendors concerns and critical analysis about the different security models and tools proposed.},

This phenomenon forces the users of the internet to get connected with the internet for a prolonged time and hence it increases the chances of the users to get caught in the web of phishing - an attack crafted by hackers to steal sensitive information by tempting the users with lucrative offers initially and then redirecting them to a fraudulent website(which the user may not suspect) where they can deceive the user by asking them to submit their credentials(usually users submit their credentials without knowing that these are fake offers created with a sole intention of stealing sensitive information). In spite of the alert and awareness given by the web community in this regard, more and more phishing artist succeed in their attack. Also these phishing artist develop novel attacks such as tab nabbing, website impersonation etc that attracts more and more internet user to be caught in the web of phishing. However many tools and methodologies have been developed to prevent phishing and to alert users orally and visually. But still the success rates of the phishing attack remains high and also the approaches related to phishing detection suffers high false positive and false negative ratio. In this paper various tools and methodologies used to prevent phishing has been analyzed and an efficient mechanism has been proposed to prevent phishing.},

Efforts to improve on this model, such as biophysical biometrics (like fingerprint or iris scan), have quickly been hacked. Behavioral biometricsâ€”keeping track of the user's behavior, and being more careful when atypical behavior is observedâ€”offers a powerful yet effortless tool in the computer security arsenal that can augment or replace other methods, improving overall security},

Man- ual encoding of linguistic information is being challenged by automated corpus-based learning as a method of providing a natural language processing system with linguistic knowledge. Al- though corpus-based approaches have been successful in many different areas of natural language processing, it is often the case that these methods capture the linguistic information they are modelling indirectly in large opaque tables of statistics. This can make it difficult to analyze, understand and improve the ability of these approaches to model underlying linguistic behavior. In this paper, we will describe a simple rule-based approach to automated learning of linguistic knowledge. This approach has been shown for a number of tasks to capture information in a clearer and more direct fashion without a compromise in performance. We present a detailed case study of this learning method applied to part-of-speech tagging.},

abstract = {Phishing email has become a popular solution among attack-ers to steal all kinds of data from people and easily breach organizations' security system. Hackers use multiple tech-niques and tricks to raise the chances of success of their attacks, like using information found on social networking websites to tailor their emails to the target's interests, or targeting employees of an organization who probably can't spot a phishing email or malicious websites and avoid send-ing emails to IT people or employees from Security depart-ment. In this paper we focus on analyzing the coherence of information contained in the different parts of the email: Header, Body, and URLs. After analyzing multiple phish-ing emails we discovered that there is always incoherence between these different parts. We created a comprehensive method which uses a set of rules that correlates the infor-mation collected from analyzing the header, body and URLs of the email and can even include the user in the detection process. We take into account that there is no such thing called perfection, so even if an email is classified as legit-imate, our system will still send a warning to the user if the email is suspicious enough. This way even if a phishing email manages to escape our system, the user can still be protected.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Issues surrounding data security and privacy are of great importance when handling sensitive health-related data for research. The emphasis in the past has been on balancing the risks to individuals with the benefit to society of the use of databases for research. However, a new way of looking at such issues is that by optimising procedures and policies regarding security and privacy of data to the extent that there is no appreciable risk to the privacy of individuals, we can create a 'win-win' situation in which everyone benefits, and pharmacoepidemiological research can flourish with public support. We discuss holistic measures, involving both information technology and people, taken to improve the security and privacy of data storage. METHODS: After an internal review, we commissioned an external audit by an independent consultant with a view to optimising our data storage and handling procedures. RESULTS: Improvements to our policies and procedures were implemented as a result of the audit. CONCLUSIONS: By optimising our storage of data, we hope to inspire public confidence and hence cooperation with the use of health care data in research.
